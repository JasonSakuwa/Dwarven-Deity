# Dwarven-Deity
A website for creating, and eventually editing the raw files for Dwarf Fortress.
I am creating this website in order to build my experience with the ins-and outs of web-development, and to possible learn how to make monetary wealth online. I also hope that it benefits the people I am making this website for. Dwarf Fortress modders.
I hope that, in the future, this website can help people get into Dwarf Fortress modding.

Feature goals include: 
- Raw creation
- Raw (random) generation
- Raw file editor
- Raw repository
